# Fundamentals of Machine Learning (COMP 451)

These are collections of notebooks for topics covered in [COMP 451](https://www.siamak.page/courses/COMP451F22/index.html) at McGill. These are based on the notebooks I originally created for COMP 551. 

List of topics with link to notebooks:
- **Probability theory** ([NBViewer](./probabilityTheory.ipynb), [Colab]()) 
- **Maximum likelihood estimation** ([NBViewer](./maximumLikelihood.ipynb), [Colab]())
- **Naive Bayes** ([NBViewer](./NaiveBayes.ipynb), [Colab]())
- **Linear Regression** ([NBViewer](./LinearRegression.ipynb), [Colab]())
- **Optimization** ([NBViewer](./Optimization.ipynb), [Colab]())
